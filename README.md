# Kafka-Spark-Twitter-Weather-Streaming
A streaming app using tweepy, weatherapi and kafka that explores the relationship between weather conditions and tweets sentiments 

The program streams tweets and then extracts the tweet user's location and the sentiment of the tweet. That way we can explore whether the tweets of people at locations with favourable temperatures tend to be happier (positive sentiments) or sadder (negative sentiments).
